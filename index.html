          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Hawes Silver Band, which was formed around 1865, fulfils many engagements in Wensleydale every year,
            including
            the Hawes Gala, Semerwater Lakeside Service, village community events in Wensleydale, and for the last
            twenty
            years has combined with the Aysgarth Voices directed by Stan Roocroft and the Young Voices Choir, directed
            by
            Barbara Roocroft to present the Annual Christmas Charity Concert to support national, regional and local
            charity
            organisations.
          </p>
          <p>The band members travel from places far away as Sedbergh, Pateley Bridge and Leyburn to rehearse on Sunday
            evenings
            in the Market House in Hawes. It is a typical brass band full of friendly people of all ages. The music is
            varied
            and the emphasis is always on everyone enjoying music-making.</p>
          <p>Though no longer a competition band, the Hawes Band were Hawes Band were the instigators of the now very
            famous
            Hardraw Scar Band Contest. They gathered together local business men from the town and organised the first
            contest
            in 1880. Whole families were involved on the contest day, providing refreshments and transporting visitors
            from
            Hawes to the beautiful landscaped grounds of Hardraw Scar, lent by the Earl of Wharnecliffe. The bandsmen
            played
            marches as they paraded through Hawes and then continued marching on to Hardraw. The school log books
            record
            that children were absent from school to help with the preparations so it was truly a community effort.</p>

              <p>Hawes Silver Band's bass trombonist, Simon Chorley of Thornton Rust, Wensleydale, has been made Youth
                Ambassador
                for what Andrew Lloyd Webber has described as "the best youth musical theatre in the world". And as
                Simon
                prepared to travel to London to receive the honour, he heard that he has been selected to play bass
                trombone
                with the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain. As a member of the orchestra, Simon will play at
                many
                famous venues including the Royal Festival Hall and the Barbican in London. Applicants for the
                orchestra
                have to have Grade 8 with distinction in their instrument and Simon was selected from 700 applicants
                after
                two auditions. </p>

              <p>Approaching the end of his first year at the Guildhall School of Music, Simon writes:
                <br> Guildhall is great! I seem to be kept nice and busy by the lack of other bass trombonists - there
                are only
                4 in the whole school and I'm the only one in both first and second years. Whereas in my year alone
                there
                are 9 tenor players. My average week consists of an orchestral repertoire class, an instrumental lesson
                (both
                individual and group), professional studies, harmony and aural classes, chamber rehearsals, and around
                3-4
                hours practice a day. I’m even getting to do some jazz department gigs in big band which is fun. Aside
                from
                all the official stuff I'm also part of a trombone quartet and octet, brass quintet and dectet, and a
                pop/jazz
                orchestra! Everyone down here is great to be around, and all my teachers are so inspiring. I’m also
                really
                enjoying being right in the centre of London but I do miss being able to sleep without some loud siren
                whizzing
                past my window!

                What may be less trumpeted is that through a single event, the annual Christmas Charity Concert in
                their home town of Hawes,
                they have with the support of the community raised more than £50,000 for a host of good causes, the
                music
                being provided by Hawes Silver Band and the Aysgarth Singers, both conducted by Stan, and the Young
                Voices
                choir conducted by Barbara.
              </p>
              <p>
                The concerts started 30 years ago by the Roocrofts have supported both local and national charities and
                2017 was the turn
                of St Teresa's Hospice, Darlington who benefited to the tune of to the tune of £2442 with match-funding
                provided
                by Barclays Bank as part of their community commitment.
