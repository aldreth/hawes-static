          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Hawes Silver Band, which was formed around 1865, fulfils many engagements in Wensleydale every year, including
            the Hawes Gala, Semerwater Lakeside Service, village community events in Wensleydale, and for the last nineteen
            years has combined with the Aysgarth Singers, East Witton Male Voice Choir and the Young Singers Choir, directed
            by Barbara Roocroft to present the Annual Christmas Charity Concert to support national, regional and local charity
            organisations.
          </p>
          <p>The band members travel from places far away as Sedbergh, Pateley Bridge and Leyburn to rehearse on Sunday evenings
            in the Market House in Hawes. It is a typical brass band full of friendly people of all ages. The music is varied
            and the emphasis is always on everyone enjoying music-making.</p>
          <p>The Hawes Band were the instigators of the now very famous Hardraw Scar Band Contest. They gathered together local
            business men from the town and organised the first contest in 1880. Whole families were involved on the contest
            day, providing refreshments and transporting visitors from Hawes to the beautiful landscaped grounds of Hardraw
            Scar, lent by the Earl of Wharnecliffe. The bandsmen played marches as they paraded through Hawes and then continued
            marching on to Hardraw. The school log books record that children were absent from school to help with the preparations
            so it was truly a community effort.</p>

              <p>Hawes Silver Band's bass trombonist, Simon Chorley of Thornton Rust, Wensleydale, has been made Youth Ambassador
                for what Andrew Lloyd Webber has described as "the best youth musical theatre in the world". And as Simon
                prepared to travel to London to receive the honour, he heard that he has been selected to play bass trombone
                with the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain. As a member of the orchestra, Simon will play at many
                famous venues including the Royal Festival Hall and the Barbican in London. Applicants for the orchestra
                have to have Grade 8 with distinction in their instrument and Simon was selected from 700 applicants after
                two auditions. </p>
