          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>
            Hawes Silver Band, which was formed around 1865, fulfils many
            engagements in Wensleydale every year, including the Semerwater
            Lakeside Service, village community events in Wensleydale, and for
            the last twenty years has combined with the East Witton Male Voice
            Choir, the Aysgarth Singers directed by Stan Roocroft and the
            Young Voices Choir, directed by Barbara Roocroft to present the
            Annual Christmas Charity Concert to support national, regional and
            local charity organisations&#8217;.
          </p>
          <p>
            The band members travel from places far away as Sedbergh, West
            Witton, Preston-under-Scar and Leyburn to rehearse on Sunday
            evenings in the Market House in Hawes. It is a typical brass band
            full of friendly people of all ages. The music is varied and the
            emphasis is always on everyone enjoying music-making.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though no longer a competition band, the Hawes Band were the
            instigators of the now very famous Hardraw Scar Band Contest. They
            gathered together local business men from the town and organised
            the first contest in 1880. Whole families were involved on the
            contest day, providing refreshments and transporting visitors from
            Hawes to the beautiful landscaped grounds of Hardraw Scar, lent by
            the Earl of Wharnecliffe. The bandsmen played marches as they
            paraded through Hawes and then continued marching on to Hardraw.
            The school log books record that children were absent from school
            to help with the preparations so it was truly a community effort.

                A unique event each year on August Bank Holiday Sunday is a
                service on the shores of Semerwater, Wensleydale's only lake,
                when Hawes Silver Band plays to accompany the hymns.
                Inevitably, conditions vary, and one year the vicar conducted
                the service knee-deep in a flooded lake but the picture shows
                a more enjoyable occasion!
